- âš¡ Fun fact: This name came from the release note of RHEL 6.1 (Tier 3 Incompatible and Unsupported CPUs):
    Tier 3 Incompatible and Unsupported CPUs
    Smokeless CPUs: Smokeless CPUs are incompatible with the linux kernel and it is doubted that any work will ever be performed to change this. They are simply too unreliable in even the most standard system configuration. Those with a CPU missing its Magic Smoke should switch to a new CPU.
